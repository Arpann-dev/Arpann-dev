## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a B.Tech Computer Science student passionate about using machine learning to solve real-world problems. Iâ€™m familiar with Python, C, and Java, and Iâ€™ve built small ML projects using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

ðŸ§  Currently learning: ML model evaluation, real-world project workflows  
ðŸš€ Working on: A missile interceptor prediction model using Python  
ðŸ“· Interests beyond code: Aviation | Military tech | Photography
